Resolved in commit `620ecca` (fix(aiwf): G4 — exclusive repo lock for mutating verbs). New `internal/repolock` package wraps POSIX `flock(2)` on `<root>/.git/aiwf.lock` (with a `<root>/.aiwf.lock` fallback for non-git dirs). Every mutating verb acquires the lock before reading the tree; read-only verbs (check, history, status, render without --write, doctor) stay lock-free. Lock acquisition has a 2s timeout; on timeout the second invocation returns `exitUsage` with a clear "another aiwf process is running" message. Stale lockfiles from crashed processes are released by the kernel automatically. Tests cover the load-bearing concurrent-add scenario (one wins / one busy), check-doesn't-lock parity, and the repolock package itself at 90.6% (two defensive branches marked `//coverage:ignore`).
