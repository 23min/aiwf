title: Pre-push hook fails opaquely when validators are missing
status: addressed
---

Resolved in commit `23f4231` (fix(aiwf): G3 — validator-unavailable is a warning, opt-in to strict). New `contractverify.CodeValidatorUnavailable` separate from `CodeEnvironment`. Default rendering: `contract-config` finding with subcode `validator-unavailable`, severity `warning`, exit 0. Opt in to strict mode via `aiwf.yaml: contracts.strict_validators: true` to upgrade to error. `aiwf doctor` now lists each configured validator with available/missing markers and explains the consequence (warning vs. blocking depending on strict_validators). aiwfyaml round-trips the new field. Tests cover the warning path, strict path, the YAML round-trip, and the doctor reporting in both modes.
