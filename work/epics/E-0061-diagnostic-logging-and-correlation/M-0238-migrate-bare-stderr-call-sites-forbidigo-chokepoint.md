## Goal

Migrate the codebase's known bare-stderr diagnostic call sites onto
`internal/logger` (M-0237), and make the discipline mechanical: a
`forbidigo` lint rule plus a policy-test backstop so a future bare print
call outside the allowlist fails CI even if the linter is ever disabled.

## Context

M-0237 shipped `internal/logger` as a standalone, unused package. This
milestone is the first thing to actually call it. Five files anchor AC-1's
work: `internal/cli/cliutil/statusline.go`, `internal/cli/root.go`,
`internal/cli/move/move.go`, `internal/cli/cancel/cancel.go`,
`internal/cli/upgrade/upgrade.go` (paths corrected from the epic-planning
draft, which predates the verb/cli package split). A repo-wide sweep found
bare `fmt.Println`/`fmt.Print`/`fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout|os.Stderr)`/
`fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout|os.Stderr)` call sites in roughly forty files, not
five — every one of them operator-facing CLI text, not diagnostic output.
AC-3's forbidigo ban covers all of them via the `cliutil` wrapper migration;
AC-1 is scoped to adding new diagnostic breadcrumbs to the five named
verbs, not converting any existing print (see AC-1 below).

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-1 — Named bare-stderr call sites emit diagnostic events through the bound logger

Per call site, the classification decision (is this call a diagnostic event
that belongs on the opt-in logger, or a genuinely operator-facing
warning/error that must stay visible on stderr regardless of `AIWF_LOG`) is
made individually — not predetermined by this spec. Applied to the five
named call sites, every existing bare-print site is operator-facing (flag
validation, install-progress lines, confirmation prompts, recovery hints) —
none qualify as a diagnostic event, so none convert. What each of these five
verbs gains instead is a genuinely new diagnostic breadcrumb: one
`logger.Info("verb.<name>.completed", …)` call at its outcome point, bound
via `WithVerb`, with structured fields, never string interpolation. Every
existing bare-print site — in these five files and everywhere else in the
tree — is migrated to the `cliutil` text-output wrapper set under AC-3,
which is the actual "operator-facing path" all such calls now share.

### AC-2 — A migrated verb run with AIWF_LOG=info fires the expected structured event

Per instrumented verb, a test drives it through its real dispatcher with
`AIWF_LOG=info` set, captures the `slog` handler, and asserts the expected
`verb.<event>` fires with the bound fields (`verb`, `entity`, `actor`) —
"test the seam, not just the layer" (CLAUDE.md §Go conventions), applied to
the logging seam specifically. `run_id` is not asserted here: `WithVerb`
doesn't bind it yet — minting the per-invocation id and wiring it through
`WithVerb` and the JSON envelope's `metadata.correlation_id` is M-0239's
scope.

### AC-3 — A non-allowlisted bare print call fails CI via forbidigo and a policy test

`forbidigo` is configured in `.golangci.yml` banning the three
destination-unambiguous bare forms — `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Print`,
`fmt.Printf` — outside the sanctioned writers (`cmd/aiwf/main.go`,
`internal/cli/cliutil/outputformat.go`'s text-mode branch,
`internal/cli/cliutil/textio.go` itself). forbidigo matches only a call's
callee expression, never its arguments, so it cannot distinguish
`fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout, …)` from `fmt.Fprintln(someOtherWriter, …)` —
banning `Fprintln`/`Fprintf` outright would also catch legitimate
writer-parameterized code. `internal/policies/logging_chokepoint.go`
(companion test `logging_chokepoint_test.go`) is the independent
AST-walking backstop — same shape as `PolicyNoHardcodedEntityPaths` — that
inspects the actual first argument and flags `fmt.Fprintln`/`fmt.Fprintf`
specifically when it is the literal `os.Stdout` or `os.Stderr` selector,
plus redundantly re-flagging the three forbidigo-covered forms so the
discipline holds even if the linter rule is ever disabled.

### AC-4 — aiwf.yaml's logging block is parsed, validated, and surfaced by aiwf doctor

Parsing and validation of the `logging:` block itself landed in M-0237 (a
dependency of that milestone's precedence-resolution AC); what's new here is
`aiwf doctor` reporting the currently *active*, fully-resolved logging
configuration (level, format, destination, and which source — env, yaml, or
default — won) so an operator can confirm what's on without reading source.

## Constraints

- The `forbidigo` rule and `logging_chokepoint_test.go` land together, in
  the same commit sequence — the rule alone, without the policy-test
  backstop, is not sufficient (CLAUDE.md's own constraint on this ADR).
- No call site is migrated without its own AC-2-shaped test; a "migrate now,
  test later" partial state does not close this milestone.

## Design notes

- ADR-0017 is the locked design. The per-site diagnostic-vs-operator-facing
  classification is this milestone's own judgment call, made once per site
  and recorded in that site's commit, not re-litigated later.

## Surfaces touched

- `internal/cli/cliutil/statusline.go`, `internal/cli/root.go`
- `internal/cli/move/move.go`, `internal/cli/cancel/cancel.go`, `internal/cli/upgrade/upgrade.go`
- `internal/cli/cliutil` (new `Errorf`/`Errorln`/`Println`/`Print` wrapper set; new `ResolveLogger` helper)
- every other `internal/` and `cmd/` file with a bare-print call site (mechanical migration to the `cliutil` wrappers)
- `.golangci.yml` (forbidigo config)
- `internal/policies/logging_chokepoint_test.go` (new)
- `internal/config`, `internal/cli/doctor` (`aiwf doctor` output)

## Out of scope

- `correlation_id` / envelope wiring, mutating-verb metadata, `--trace` —
  M-0239.
- Any call site not in the named list — a new one discovered during this
  milestone is migrated too if trivial, or filed as a gap if it's a larger
  detour.

## Dependencies

- M-0237 — `internal/logger` must exist before anything can call it.

## Work log

### AC-1 / AC-2 — Diagnostic breadcrumbs on the five named verbs

Added `cliutil.ResolveLogger` (env-var-only precedence tier; falls back to a
discard logger on any resolve/open failure so diagnostic logging can never
affect a verb's own exit code) and a `cliutil.Errorf`/`Errorln`/`Printf`/
`Println`/`Print` wrapper set. Instrumented `cancel`, `move`, `upgrade`, and
the statusline scaffold/remove flows with one `WithVerb`-bound
`logger.Info("verb.completed", …)` call each, firing only on a genuinely
successful outcome; migrated all five files' pre-existing operator-facing
prints to the new wrappers; migrated `root.go`'s prints too (no diagnostic
event there — it is pure dispatch). Each site's AC-2 seam test drives the
real Cobra dispatcher (`cli.Execute`) with `AIWF_LOG=info`, reads the
resulting JSON log line, and separately confirms a failed run emits no
event and a disabled run creates no log file at all. `wf-vacuity` mutation
probes (unconditional emission, swapped verb/entity/actor argument order,
wrong stream, closing the real `os.Stderr`) all caught by the test suite;
one probe (the stderr-close guard) found and fixed a real test gap where
the assertion targeted the wrong (capture-swapped) stream. · commit
`14c81e3a` · full `internal/cli/...` tree green, `check-fast` clean.

### AC-3 — forbidigo ban + logging_chokepoint policy backstop

Mechanically migrated every remaining bare `fmt.Println`/`Print`/`Printf`/
`Fprintln(stdout|stderr)`/`Fprintf(stdout|stderr)` call site (38 files) to
the `cliutil` wrapper set — pure substitution, zero behavior change,
confirmed via the full test suite passing unchanged (commit `2ac84846`).
Added three `forbidigo` rules banning the destination-unambiguous bare
forms (`fmt.Println`/`Print`/`Printf`); confirmed empirically (a throwaway
probe rule + file, since forbidigo's actual matching semantics weren't
documented in this repo) that forbidigo matches only a call's callee
expression, never its arguments — it structurally cannot distinguish
`fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout, …)` from `fmt.Fprintln(someOtherWriter, …)`.
Added `internal/policies/logging_chokepoint.go` (+ companion test) as the
independent AST-walking backstop that inspects the actual first argument,
mirroring `atomic_write_chokepoint.go`'s shape; wired into
`policies_test.go`'s self-check registry, confirmed clean against aiwf's
own repo. `wf-vacuity` mutation probes (disable the allowlist, narrow the
bare-form switch, always-match the writer check) all caught; one probe
survived undetected on first attempt (the writer-check mutation, since the
"arbitrary writer" fixture used a bare identifier that fails an earlier
guard before ever reaching the mutated line) — added a
non-stdio-but-still-`os.*`-selector fixture to close the gap. · commits
`14c81e3a`, `2ac84846`, `83afce24` · `check-fast` clean, self-check
policy passes against aiwf's own tree.
