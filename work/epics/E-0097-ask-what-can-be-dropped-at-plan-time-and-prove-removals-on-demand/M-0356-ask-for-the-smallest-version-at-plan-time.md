## Goal

Put the subtraction question at the moment work is proposed — inside both planning
rituals and in the always-on guidance — so it fires whether or not a ritual is
invoked, while a cut still costs nothing.

## Closes

- (none)

## Context

Both planning rituals confirm a plan rather than challenge it. `aiwfx-plan-epic`
spells scope back and asks for a yes. `aiwfx-plan-milestones` sizes each candidate
with three arms — keep, split, fold into a sibling — and none of the three drops
work, which is the shape [`growth.md`](../../../docs/design/growth.md) names as the
growth mechanism. A planning session run through the epic ritual produced a plan
that one question from the maintainer visibly shrank afterwards, which places the
missing step inside the ritual's own output rather than beside it. The always-on
guidance carries the economy priming and no obligation to produce a cut list.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-1 — plan-epic offers the smallest version and argues the delta

`aiwfx-plan-epic` presents the smallest version that solves the stated problem
before the proposed one, then states what the larger version adds with an argument
per addition. **Pass criterion**: a recorded planning run on a real candidate whose
exchange carries both, against the same ritual at the prior revision on the same
candidate carrying neither; the record holds the command, the expectation written
before the run, the observed exchange and the environment. **Edge cases**: a
candidate whose smallest version is the proposed one, where the step says so rather
than inventing something smaller; a candidate the user has already constrained,
where the delta is theirs rather than the assistant's. **Code references**: the step
lands in the embedded `aiwfx-plan-epic` ritual body; the record lands in this spec's
`## Validation`.

### AC-2 — plan-milestones drops an unrequired candidate before allocating its id

`aiwfx-plan-milestones` drops a candidate not required by the epic's success
criteria, and the drop happens before `aiwf add milestone` allocates an id for it.
**Pass criterion**: a recorded run over a decomposition containing such a candidate,
where the ritual names it as a drop and no id is allocated for it; the record holds
command, expectation, observation and environment. **Edge cases**: a candidate
required only indirectly, through another candidate it enables; a decomposition
where nothing qualifies, which produces a stated *nothing was droppable* rather than
silence. **Code references**: the sizing arm and the gate land in the embedded
`aiwfx-plan-milestones` ritual body.

### AC-3 — A planning exchange invoking no ritual produces the cut list

A planning exchange that invokes no ritual arrives with its cut list. **Pass
criterion**: a recorded exchange in a session with the guidance installed and no
planning skill invoked, where the proposal carries drop candidates drawn from what
it itself drafted; the record holds command, expectation, observation and
environment, including the host and the installed guidance revision. **Edge cases**:
a proposal with nothing to drop, which states that rather than padding the list; a
request for one change, which is not a plan and does not trigger the list. **Code
references**: the clause lands in `internal/skills/embedded-guidance/aiwf-guidance.md`.

## Constraints

- The clause does not exceed the median length of the fragment's existing top-level
  rules.
- **The clause's commit carries this milestone's `aiwf-entity` trailer, and that is
  the whole of its registration.** The guidance inventory can trace any fragment
  rule to the entity that placed it, so a second record would be a copy.
- **No operating-anchor entry for the new rule.** An anchor is a presence assertion
  over shipped prose, and the anchors policy is rewritten under E-0092.
- Shipped text carries no aiwf id, no path into this tree, and no rationale.
- The drop candidates come from the proposal as drafted, never invented extras.
- The cut list is a disposition the human grades, never a verdict that a plan is
  minimal — G-0585 records why a clearance earned by reading is worse than none.
- Each criterion here claims an observation, so its evidence is the record of
  command, expectation, observation and environment rather than an assertion.

## Design notes

- The clause's home follows E-0092's own audience test; the epic's constraints hold
  the argument.
- **Retirement trigger for the clause**: E-0092's before-and-after rubric. If plans
  do not come out smaller, the rule goes.
- D-0070 forbids pinning a phrase in shipped prose, which is why no criterion here
  asserts the presence of the text it adds.
