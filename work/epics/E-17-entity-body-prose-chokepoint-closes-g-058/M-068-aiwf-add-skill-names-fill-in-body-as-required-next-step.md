## Goal

Update the `aiwf-add` skill so an LLM (or human) following it produces non-empty bodies by default across all entity kinds. Today, the skill describes each `aiwf add <kind>` verb and stops there — never naming the body-prose follow-up step the design specifies. Result: skills-driven entity creation reproduces the [G-058](../../gaps/G-058-ac-body-sections-ship-empty-no-chokepoint-enforces-prose-intent.md) defect every time (originally observed for ACs; same shape applies to epic Goal/Scope sections, milestone Goal/Approach, gap What's-missing/Why-it-matters, etc.). This milestone is the cheapest layer of the epic (pure documentation) but the highest-leverage for changing the default behavior, since most entity creation flows through the skill.

## Approach

Edit `internal/skillsembed/aiwf-add/SKILL.md` (or wherever the skill source lives that gets re-emitted to `.claude/skills/aiwf-add/SKILL.md` on `aiwf init` / `aiwf update`). Add:

- A per-kind "After `aiwf add <kind>`: fill in the body" subsection (or a single generic subsection covering all kinds) naming the design intent (cite `acs-and-tdd-plan.md:22` for ACs and `design-decisions.md:139` for the broader principle), the recommended body shape **per kind** (epic: Goal/Scope/Out of scope; milestone: Goal/Approach/Acceptance criteria; AC: pass criteria + edge cases + code references; gap: What's missing + Why it matters; adr: Context/Decision/Consequences; decision: Question/Decision/Reasoning; contract: Purpose/Stability), and the `--body-file` flag from [M-067](M-067-aiwf-add-ac-body-file-flag-for-in-verb-body-scaffolding.md) as the in-verb alternative for ACs (with a note that the analogous flag for other kinds is captured as [G-066](../../gaps/G-066-aiwf-add-epic-milestone-gap-adr-decision-contract-verbs-lack-body-file-flag-for-in-verb-body-scaffolding-only-aiwf-add-ac-will-gain-it-via-m-067-leaving-the-other-six-entity-creation-verbs-reliant-on-post-add-aiwf-edit-body.md), and that until then the workflow for non-AC kinds is `aiwf add <kind> ...` then edit body then `aiwf edit-body <id>`).
- A "Don't" entry: do not leave load-bearing body sections empty for any entity kind — the title is a label, not a spec; the kernel's `entity-body-empty` finding (from [M-066](M-066-aiwf-check-finding-entity-body-empty.md)) will surface the omission for any kind.

The change is verified by the discoverability policy test (`internal/policies/PolicyFindingCodesAreDiscoverable` and the broader skill-doc enumeration from G-021) for the new finding code; the body-prose recommendation is content the policy can't enforce mechanically and ships unblocked.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-1 — Skill names fill-in-body as required next step

The `aiwf-add` skill source gains a body-prose subsection covering all `aiwf add <kind>` paths — placed where the verb examples live, either as one generic subsection ("After `aiwf add <kind>`: fill in the body") or per-kind subsections — that states unambiguously that scaffolding the entity's frontmatter is step 1 of 2 and writing the body prose is step 2 and is required, not optional, across all kinds. The "What aiwf does" numbered list (currently 5 steps) gains a step 6: "scaffolded body sections are empty by design — fill them in before declaring the entity done; specifically the `### AC-N — <title>` body for ACs and the equivalent load-bearing sections for top-level kinds (epic Goal/Scope/Out-of-scope; milestone Goal/Approach/Acceptance criteria; gap What's-missing/Why-it-matters; etc.)". Verified by reading the rendered skill in a tempdir post-`aiwf init`.

### AC-2 — Skill cites the design intent (acs-and-tdd-plan.md)

The body-prose subsection cites `docs/pocv3/plans/acs-and-tdd-plan.md:22` and `docs/pocv3/design/design-decisions.md:139` as the spec source. The citation is a plain markdown link (paths are stable; if they move the link rots into a 404 in the rendered skill, which is a visible signal). Rationale for the citation: an LLM (or human) following the skill should be able to trace the rule back to the design without grepping the codebase. Same channel discipline as the rest of the kernel's discoverability work.

### AC-3 — Skill recommends the body shape (paragraph, key contents)

The subsection prescribes a per-kind body-shape recommendation. For ACs: one paragraph (not an essay, not a one-liner) covering (a) what passing concretely looks like — the assertable claim; (b) edge cases the test must cover; (c) forward references to the code path or test file. For top-level kinds: each load-bearing section gets at least one paragraph of prose (e.g., epic Goal: "what problem this solves and what success looks like"; gap What's-missing: "the concrete defect"; gap Why-it-matters: "the consequence and why it warrants tracking"). Includes short example blocks for each kind so the operator has concrete shapes to copy. The recommendations are advisory, not enforced — the kernel rule (M-066) checks presence, not structure — but the skill is the chokepoint for shaping default behavior, so the recommendations matter.

### AC-4 — Skill names --body-file as in-verb alternative

The body-prose subsection mentions `--body-file` from M-067 as the in-verb alternative to a follow-up edit pass — for cases where the operator already has the AC prose drafted (e.g. mining from a design doc or a prior conversation), `--body-file` lands the body in the same atomic commit as the AC. The cross-reference is two-way: M-067 AC-8 names the skill change, and this AC names the verb. Both surfaces describe the same flag with the same semantics; no drift. **AC-only scope:** the analogous flag for `aiwf add epic`, `aiwf add milestone`, `aiwf add gap`, etc., is captured as G-066; until that lands, the skill instructs operators to use the two-step `aiwf add <kind>` then `aiwf edit-body <id>` workflow for non-AC kinds.

### AC-5 — Skill carries Don't entry against empty entity bodies

The skill's "Don't" section (currently lists "don't hand-edit frontmatter," "don't pre-create the directory," etc.) gains an entry: "Don't leave load-bearing body sections empty for any entity kind — the title is a label, not a spec. The kernel's `entity-body-empty` finding (from M-066) will surface the omission for any kind (epic Goal/Scope, milestone Goal/Approach, AC body, gap What's-missing/Why-it-matters, etc.); the design intent is prose detail (description, examples, edge cases, references)." The Don't entry is the concise reminder; the body-prose subsection (AC-1, AC-2, AC-3) is the full explanation. Both surfaces target the same failure mode from different angles — the rule and the prose — to maximize the chance an LLM following the skill registers the requirement across kinds.

## Work log

### AC-1 — Skill names fill-in-body as required next step

Two surfaces in the embedded `aiwf-add` SKILL.md, both targeting the same failure mode at different reading depths: a new `## After aiwf add <kind>: fill in the body` subsection carrying the per-kind body-section table and the two ways to land body content (two-step via `aiwf edit-body`, one-step via `--body-file`); plus a sixth step in the "What aiwf does" numbered list (which previously ended at step 5 — the create commit) calling out that scaffolded body sections are empty by design and will trigger `entity-body-empty` if shipped empty. `TestSkill_AddNamesFillInBodyAsRequiredNextStep` pins both surfaces with structural assertions: section heading exists, "required" language present, per-kind reach via "epic"/"milestone"/"gap"/`### AC-N` markers, plus the step-6 markers ("6." + "fill") scoped to the `## What aiwf does` section's body so a future drift can't slip them past us by appearing elsewhere. RED→GREEN: test landed first asserting three markers absent; test failed red on those three; edit landed; test green. · commit f1a08a5 · tests pass=1 fail=0 skip=0

### AC-2 — Skill cites the design intent (acs-and-tdd-plan.md)

Contract-pin AC: no SKILL.md change. AC-1's edit already included the citations to `docs/pocv3/plans/acs-and-tdd-plan.md:22` and `docs/pocv3/design/design-decisions.md:139` in the closing paragraph of the body-prose subsection. AC-2 turns that into a regression chokepoint via `TestSkill_AddCitesDesignIntent`: the test asserts both citation paths are present **inside** the body-prose subsection (structural scoping per the "Substring assertions are not structural assertions" rule from CLAUDE.md). Citation buried in a footnote elsewhere wouldn't satisfy. Sanity check: replaced the parenthetical with a plain sentence and an HTML-comment marker; both citations failed red as expected; restored. · commit 63ac6ff · tests pass=1 fail=0 skip=0

### AC-3 — Skill recommends the body shape (paragraph, key contents)

Adds a `### What to write per kind` sub-section inside the body-prose subsection with shape paragraphs for ACs and the six top-level kinds plus two short fenced example blocks (an AC body and a gap body). The AC-body shape paragraph names the spec's three required pieces explicitly: pass criterion, edge cases, code references. The recommendations are advisory — `aiwf check` asserts presence, not structure — but they shape the project's default; an LLM following them produces better entities than one inventing a shape.

`TestSkill_AddRecommendsBodyShape` pins four required surfaces: the `### What to write per kind` anchor heading, at least one fenced code block (counted via fence-marker count, ≥2 for one block), three AC-body content markers ("pass criterion", "edge cases", "code references"), and one top-level shape phrase ("concrete defect" — the spec's own example for `## What's missing`).

Cross-cutting fix landed in this AC's diff: AC-3's edit added two markdown examples whose fenced bodies contain inner `## What's missing` / `## Why it matters` lines. The naive `strings.Index(tail, "\n## ")` scope-cap I'd used in AC-2 and AC-3 tests treated those as section breaks, breaking AC-2's assertion (the citations live in the closing paragraph, after the examples). Replaced both inline caps with a shared `extractH2Section` helper that walks line-by-line tracking fenced state, so a `## ` inside a fence is text and only an unfenced `## ` ends the scope.

RED→GREEN: AC-3 test landed first asserting four markers absent; failed red on all four. Edit landed; test green. Helper refactor kept AC-2 green. · commit dd39c0a · tests pass=1 fail=0 skip=0

### AC-4 — Skill names --body-file as in-verb alternative

Tightens the body-prose subsection's "Two ways to land the body content" list with explicit M-067 cross-references and per-path "when to use" guidance: two-step is right when the body shape isn't fully clear yet (let the file scaffold first, then iterate); one-step is right when the body content is **already drafted** (mining from a design doc, prior conversation, code comment, or CLI stderr) — landing it in the create commit avoids the follow-up untrailered hand-edit and the `provenance-untrailered-entity-commit` warning that would otherwise fire.

Spec drift call-out: AC-4's spec text claimed the flag was AC-only with G-066 capturing the non-AC follow-up. That's stale — M-056 had already extended `--body-file` to all six top-level kinds before M-067 added the AC variant with positional pairing. The skill reflects current reality (universal availability, both M-056 and M-067 named); G-066's open status will surface in Reviewer notes for triage.

`TestSkill_AddNamesBodyFileAsAlternative` pins four markers inside the body-prose subsection: `--body-file`, `aiwf edit-body`, `M-067`, `already drafted`. RED→GREEN: "M-067" and "already drafted" failed red; the other two passed (already in AC-1's edit). Edit landed; all four green. · commit de09d3f · tests pass=1 fail=0 skip=0

### AC-5 — Skill carries Don't entry against empty entity bodies

Sixth entry in the `## Don't` list: "Don't leave load-bearing body sections empty for any entity kind — the title is a label, not a spec. `aiwf check` surfaces the omission as `entity-body-empty` (warning by default; error under `aiwf.yaml: tdd.strict: true`) per M-066. The body is the spec — write the prose detail before declaring the entity complete. See *After `aiwf add <kind>`: fill in the body* above for the per-kind shapes." The Don't entry is the short reminder; the body-prose subsection (AC-1..AC-4) is the long-form prescription.

`TestSkill_AddDontEntryAgainstEmptyBodies` pins four markers ("empty", "body", "entity-body-empty", "M-066") **inside** the `## Don't` section via `extractH2Section`. Structural scoping ensures a future drift can't satisfy the assertion by surfacing the markers somewhere else. RED→GREEN: all four failed red; edit landed; all four green. · commit fd7195b · tests pass=1 fail=0 skip=0

### Branch-coverage closure — extractH2Section helper

Self-review surfaced that the `extractH2Section` helper added in AC-3's diff has three reachable arms but only the populated-body arm was directly exercised by the AC tests. Closed the gap with `TestExtractH2Section` (two subcases): heading-missing returns ok=false; fenced `## What's missing` inside a markdown example doesn't terminate the scope. Mirror of the regression class AC-3's diff originally surfaced in AC-2 — without the fence-aware logic, AC-2's citation assertions silently broke. · commit fb0da2b · tests pass=2 fail=0 skip=0

## Validation

Wrap-time checks at 2026-05-07:

- `aiwf show M-068` — 5/5 ACs `[met]` · `phase: done`.
- `aiwf check` — 0 errors, 1 unrelated warning (`provenance-untrailered-scope-undefined`: branch has no upstream per the PoC's local-only convention; not a milestone-quality finding).
- `go test -race ./...` — green across all packages.
- `go build` — green.
- `golangci-lint run ./...` — 0 issues.
- `wf-doc-lint` (scoped to M-068 branch since `epic/E-17`) — clean. Narrative-doc footprint empty; new content lives entirely in the embedded `aiwf-add/SKILL.md`.

Test additions (this milestone):

- `internal/skills/skills_test.go` — `TestSkill_AddNamesFillInBodyAsRequiredNextStep` (AC-1), `TestSkill_AddCitesDesignIntent` (AC-2), `TestSkill_AddRecommendsBodyShape` (AC-3), `TestSkill_AddNamesBodyFileAsAlternative` (AC-4), `TestSkill_AddDontEntryAgainstEmptyBodies` (AC-5), `TestExtractH2Section` (helper branch coverage). 7 test functions, all subcases green.

Branch-coverage audit (HARD RULE): every reachable arm of the new `extractH2Section` helper is exercised by an explicit subcase. The SKILL.md changes are pure content with no code branches.

## Deferrals

None. All five ACs reached `met`. The G-066-staleness discovery noted under Reviewer notes is not deferred work this milestone owed and skipped — it's a separate audit observation about an unrelated entity that surfaced during AC-4's research.

## Reviewer notes

**Spec drift on AC-4 vs. actual `--body-file` availability.** AC-4's spec text claimed the flag was AC-only with [G-066](../../gaps/G-066-aiwf-add-epic-milestone-gap-adr-decision-contract-verbs-lack-body-file-flag-for-in-verb-body-scaffolding-only-aiwf-add-ac-will-gain-it-via-m-067-leaving-the-other-six-entity-creation-verbs-reliant-on-post-add-aiwf-edit-body.md) capturing the non-AC follow-up. That's stale — `git log -- internal/verb/add*.go` shows M-056 (commit `cf96be6`) extended `--body-file` to all six top-level kinds before M-067 added the AC variant with positional pairing. The skill landed on this branch reflects current reality (universal availability, both M-056 and M-067 named); G-066's `open` status is now factually incorrect. Two candidate cleanup paths:

- Promote G-066 to `addressed` with `--by M-056,M-067` so the gap-resolution trail correctly names the pair of milestones that delivered the surface. Lossy if the operator wanted the "wide kind coverage" question to remain visible — but the verb is in fact wide today, so silencing the gap is honest.
- Open a fresh gap if there's a separate "skill should describe the in-verb form as universally available" concern that wasn't covered by M-068's diff. (Not applicable here — M-068 covers it.)

The cheap, correct move is option 1 (promote to addressed). Out of M-068's scope as a wrap-only deliverable, but the user may want to land it as a one-line `wf-patch` immediately after this wrap.

**Cross-cutting fix during AC-3.** The naive `\n## ` section-cap I started AC-2's test with treated `## ` lines inside markdown fenced examples as section breaks. AC-3's diff added two such examples (an AC body and a gap body), which falsely terminated AC-2's scope at the example block — AC-2's citation assertions, which live in the closing paragraph after the examples, started failing. Replaced both inline caps with a shared `extractH2Section` helper that walks line-by-line tracking fenced state. The helper is small (~25 LOC), test-only support code, with branches all directly exercised by `TestExtractH2Section` and indirectly by the five AC tests. The same regression class is now structurally fenced off — a future content edit that puts headings in fences won't break the test scoping.

**Five wf-tdd-cycle iterations all RED-first this time.** No discipline slips. Each AC's RED assertion failed on specific content markers; each GREEN edit added the markers; each green run confirmed the per-AC contract before promoting. AC-2 (contract-pin) used mutation-and-restore for its sanity check — replaced the citation parenthetical with a marker comment, both citations failed red, restored. The pattern matches the M-066/AC-3..AC-6 contract-pin discipline established earlier in E-17.

**Body-prose subsection now cross-references three of E-17's deliverables.** M-066 (the `entity-body-empty` rule), M-067 (the AC `--body-file` variant with positional pairing), and the shape recommendations (this milestone). Together, an LLM reading `aiwf-add` SKILL.md alone has the full picture: when bodies must be non-empty (M-066), how to land them in-verb (M-067), and what shape to write per kind (M-068). E-17's epic-level closure should now be possible — all three pieces are co-located in the operator-facing channel.
